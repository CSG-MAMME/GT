\subsection[Minors 1 - 1]{Prove that every 3-connected graph contains $K_4$ as a minor.}

\subsection[Minors 1 - 2]{Show that a graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain a subdivision of $K_4$ or $K_{2,3}$.}

Done - Problem 11 of Planar Graphs.

\subsection[Minors 1 - 3]{Show that a series-parallel graph with $n$ vertices has at most $2n -3$ edges. Show also that $\chi(G) \leq 3$.}

\subsection[Minors 1 - 5]{Let $H$ be a graph. Show that there is a finite list $H_1, \dots, H_K$ of graphs such tat a graph contains $H$ as a minor if and only if contains $H_i$ as a subdivision for $i$.}

\subsection[Minors 1 - 6]{Show that if $G$ is a $k$-sum of $G_1$ and $G_2$ then $\chi(G) \leq \max\{\chi{G_1}, \chi{G_2}\}$. Prove the Hadwiger conjecture for $t \geq 3$: if $\chi(G) > t$, then $G$ contains $K_{t+1}$ as a minor.}
