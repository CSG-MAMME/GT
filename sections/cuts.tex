\section{Cuts in Graphs}

\subsection[Cuts - 2]{2. Give upper and lower bounds for the isoperimetric number of $Pay(p)$ and give asymptotic expressions for this number when $p \rightarrow \infty$.}

Use that the adjacency matrix is circulant.

\subsection[Cuts - 3]{3. Deduce the spectral bound for the diameter.}

The key observation to use here is that if $A^m > 0$ then diam$(G) \leq m$.

\subsection[Cuts - 4]{4. Let $k$ be the largest integer such that, for every set $S$ of cardinality at most $\frac{n}{6}$, the $k$-th ball of $S$ is three times as large as $S$. Give a bound for this parameter for a $r$-regular graph in terms of the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of $G$.}

\subsection[Cuts - 6]{6. Let $G$ be a vertex symmetric graph with diameter $D$. Show that $i(G) \geq \frac{1}{2D}$.}
