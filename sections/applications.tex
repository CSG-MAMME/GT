\section{Applications of the Laplacian}

\subsection[Applications - 1]{1. Show that $\tau(G) = \frac{1}{n} \mu_2 \mu_3 \dots \mu_n$, where $0 = \mu_1 \leq \mu_2 \leq \dots \leq \mu_n$ are the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of $G$.}

\subsection[Applications - 4]{4. Prove a version of the Matrix-Tree theorem for multigraphs.}

Mine.

\subsection[Applications - 10]{10. By checking $C_5^2$ give a lower bound on the Shannon capapcity of the pentagon. Prove that $\theta(C_5) = \sqrt{5}$.}

\subsection[Applications - 11]{11. Compute the Shannon capacity of the Petersen graph.}

Use $\alpha(G) \leq \theta(G) \leq \frac{-n \lambda}{r - \lambda}$ and that the smallest eigenvalue of the Petersen graph is $-2$.
