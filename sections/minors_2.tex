\section{Graph Minors 2}

\subsection[Minors 2 - 1]{Show that every graph $G$ with treewidth $tw(G) \leq k$ has chromatic number $\chi(G) \leq k$.}

\subsection[Minors 2 - 3]{Let $G$ be a $k$-sum of graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, $tw(G) \leq \max\{tw(G_1), tw(G_2)\}$.}

\subsection[Minors 2 - 5]{Show that $tw(P_n \square P_n) = n-1$.}

\subsection[Minors 2 - 7]{Is the class of trees well-ordered by the subgraph ordering? Is the class of graphs well-ordered by the topological minor relation?}
